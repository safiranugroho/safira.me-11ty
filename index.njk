<h1>Hi, I'm Safira.</h1>
<p>
  Least dev-iest dev you'll ever meet probably. <br />
  Whatever that means.
</p>
<p>
  I'm a consultant/software developer at ThoughtWorks. I grew up in
  Jakarta, Indonesia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¨ but currently based in Melbourne, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º.
  That oughtta show ya a glimpse of my identity crisis.
</p>
<p>
  I'm still figuring out the content of this site, but it will probably
  be a concoction of some stream-of-consciousness blog posts and any
  experiments I do outside of work. Nothing too mindblowing honestly.
</p>
<p>
  If any of this strikes your fancy or you just want to say hello,
  connect with me on 
  <a href="https://www.twitter.com/hisafira/">Twitter</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/safiranugroho/">LinkedIn</a>,
  check out my many unfinished code on 
  <a href="https://github.com/safiranugroho">GitHub</a>, or
