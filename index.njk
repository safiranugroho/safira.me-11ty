<h1>Hi, I'm Safira.</h1>
<p>
  Dev at ThoughtWorks, but views expressed here are my own.<br />
  She/her/dia. ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¨<br />
  Based in Melbourne. ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º

  I'm still figuring out the content of this site, but it will probably
  be a concoction of some stream-of-consciousness blog posts and any
  experiments I do outside of work.
